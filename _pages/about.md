Hello! I am a second year Masters of Language Technologies (MLT) student in the <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">Language Technologies Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnabás Póczos</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, with a particular focus on <strong>generalization, robustness</strong>, and <strong>parameter/data efficient learning</strong>. 

Currently, I am working on information theoretic measures for improving fairness and robustness of ML/NLP systems. I've also been fortunate to collaborate with several esteemed facutly at CMU, such as <a href="http://www.phontron.com/index.php">Graham Neubig</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/">Aditi Raghunathan</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/">Ameet Talwalkar</a>, <a href="https://strubell.github.io">Emma Strubell</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/">David R. Mortensen</a>, on various research projects that analyze and improve generalization and efficiency of neural networks. For the summer of 2023, I interned with <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com">Apple Research (Siri)</a>, investigating the emergent capabilities of LLMs for dialog applications. 

Before coming to CMU, I was a Predoctoral Researcher / Research Associate with <a href="https://tanmoychak.com/">Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty</a> at the <a href="https://www.lcs2.in/">Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2), IIIT Delhi</a> working on various research projects in NLP, multimodal machine learning, social computing, and conversational systems. My research has been published at top NLP/ML conferences such as <strong>ACL, EMNLP, EACL, SIGKDD</strong>, and <strong>IJCAI</strong>. 

You can learn more about my projects in the [Publication](./publications) or [Projects](./projects) section. You can find my detailed CV [here](./assets/pdf/CMU_CV_latest.pdf).

I'm eager to connect with my academic peers! If our research interests align (or diverge) in intriguing ways, I'd be delighted to explore potential collaborations or simply exchange ideas! Additionally, I'm also looking for <strong>research internship opportunities for Summer 2024</strong> to work on data-centric machine learning or generalization / fairness / efficiency of LLMs. Please feel free to reach out via email, if there is a good fit!
