Hi! I am a Masters of Language Technologies (MLT) student in the <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">Language Technologies Institute</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. My research focuses on machine learning and natural language processing.

At CMU, I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnabás Póczos</a>, where I am currently working on information theoretic measures for improving fairness and robustness of ML/NLP systems. I have also worked with <a href="http://www.phontron.com/index.php">Graham Neubig</a> on exploring the impact of multitask learning on worst-group generalization. I've also had the privilege of collaborating on various research projects with esteemed faculty at CMU, including <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/">Aditi Raghunathan</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/">Ameet Talwalkar</a>, <a href="https://strubell.github.io">Emma Strubell</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/">David R. Mortensen</a>. For the summer of 2023, I interned with Apple Research (Siri), investigating the emergent capabilities of LLMs for dialog applications. 

Prior to CMU, I was a Predoctoral Researcher / Research Associate working with <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty</a> at the <a href="https://www.lcs2.in/">Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2), IIIT Delhi</a> on different research projects in NLP, spanning multimodal machine learning, social computing, and conversational systems. My research has been published at top NLP/ML conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, EACL, SIGKDD, and IJCAI.
