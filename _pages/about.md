Hello ! I am a first year CS PhD student at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu"> University of Southern California </a>, <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu"> Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science </a>, advised by the amazing <a href="https://swabhs.com"> Swabha Swayamdipta </a>. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">Language Technologies Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, with a <a href="https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/mlt/">Masters of Language Technologies (MLT)</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnabás Póczos</a> and <a href="http://www.phontron.com"> Graham Neubig </a>. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, with a particular focus on Robust, Generalizable, & Trustworthy NLP. 

Before coming to CMU, I was a Predoctoral Researcher (Research Associate with) <a href="https://tanmoychak.com/">Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty</a> at the <a href="https://www.lcs2.in/">Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2), IIT Delhi</a> , where I worked on various research projects in multimodal machine learning, social computing, and dialog systems.

You can learn more about my publications [here](./publications). You can find my detailed CV [here](./assets/pdf/Atharva_Kulkarni_CV_detailed.pdf).

I'm eager to connect with my academic peers! If our research interests align (or diverge) in intriguing ways, I'd be delighted to explore potential collaborations or simply exchange ideas! Additionally, I'm also looking for <strong>research internship opportunities for Summer 2025</strong>. Please feel free to reach out via email, if there is a good fit!
