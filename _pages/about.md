Hello ! I am a first year CS PhD student at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu"> University of Southern California </a>, <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu"> Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science </a>, advised by the amazing <a href="https://swabhs.com"> Swabha Swayamdipta </a>. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">Language Technologies Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, with a <a href="https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/mlt/">Masters of Language Technologies (MLT)</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnabás Póczos</a> and <a href="http://www.phontron.com"> Graham Neubig </a>. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, with a particular focus on Robust, Generalizable, & Trustworthy NLP. 
<!-- Specifically my research revolved around answering the following researh questions: 
<ul>
  <li>Analyzing and enhancing generalization, robustness, and fairness of present-day neural networks (particularly LLMs).</li>
  <li>Learning with limited data, active learning, data valuation algorithms, and data-centric machine learning.</li>
  <li>Parameter efficient machine learning.</li>
</ul>   -->

<!-- Currently, I am working on information theoretic measures for improving fairness and robustness of ML/NLP systems. I've also been fortunate to collaborate with several esteemed facutly at CMU, such as <a href="http://www.phontron.com/index.php">Graham Neubig</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/">Aditi Raghunathan</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/">Ameet Talwalkar</a>, <a href="https://strubell.github.io">Emma Strubell</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/">David R. Mortensen</a>, on various research projects that analyze and improve generalization and efficiency of neural networks. For the summer of 2023, I interned with <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com">Apple Research (Siri)</a>, investigating the emergent capabilities of LLMs for dialog applications.  -->

Before coming to CMU, I was a Predoctoral Researcher (Research Associate with) <a href="https://tanmoychak.com/">Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty</a> at the <a href="https://www.lcs2.in/">Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2), IIT Delhi</a> , where I worked on various research projects in multimodal machine learning, social computing, and dialog systems.
You can learn more about my publications [here](./publications). You can find my detailed CV [here](./assets/pdf/Atharva_Kulkarni_CV_detailed.pdf).

I'm eager to connect with my academic peers! If our research interests align (or diverge) in intriguing ways, I'd be delighted to explore potential collaborations or simply exchange ideas! Additionally, I'm also looking for <strong>research internship opportunities for Summer 2025</strong>. Please feel free to reach out via email, if there is a good fit!
